# ATC
Aww That's Cube (ATC), my first ever Unity project, was a cube game I developed back in the summer. The game contains one level/scene where you need to dodge all cubic obstacles that come your way to make it to the finish line. This game's foundation lies in YouTuber Brackeys' "How To Make A Video Game In Unity" series. 

Development period: July 5-14, 2020.
